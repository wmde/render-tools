/**
 * This class represents an active connection to a graph. It can be seen as the local
 * interface to the graph that allows the graph to be queried and manipulated,
 * using the command set specified for GraphCore and GraphServ. The communication with
 * the peer process that manages the actual graph (a slave GraphCore instance or
 * a remote GraphCore server) is performed by an instance of the apprpriate subclass of
 * gpTransport.
 * 
 * Instances of gpConnection that use the appropriate transport can be created conveniently
 * using the static factory methods called new_xxx_connection.
 * 
 * Besides some methods for managing the connection and some utility functions,
 * gpConnection exposes the GraphCore and GraphServ command sets. The commands are
 * exposed as "virtual" methods: they are not implemented explicitely,
 * instead, the __call() method is used to map method calls to GraphCore commands.
 * No local checks are performed on the command call, so it's up to the peer to
 * decide which commands exist. Note that this means that a gpConnection actually exposes
 * more commands if it is connected to a GraphServ instance (simply because the peer
 * then supports more commands).
 * 
 * The mapping of method calls to commands is performed as follows:
 * 
 * * underscores are converted to dashes: the method add_arcs corresponds to the 
 *   add-arcs command in GraphCore. 
 * 
 * * any int or string parameters passed to the method are passed on to the
 *   command call, in the order they were specified.
 * 
 * * parameters that are instances of gpDataSource will be used to pass a data set
 *   to the command. That is, rows from the data source are passed to the command as
 *   input.
 * 
 * * parameters that are instances of gpDataSink will be used to handle any data
 *   the command outputs. That is, rows from the command's output data set
 *   will be passed to the data sink, one by one.
 * 
 * * parameters that are arrays are wrapped in a new instance of gpArraySource and used 
 *   as input for the command, as described above. This is convenient for passing 
 *   data directly to the command.
 * 
 * * parameters given as null or false are ignored.
 * 
 * * other types of arguments trigger a gpUsageException
 * 
 * A command called in this way, using its "plain" method counterpart, always
 * returns the status string from the peer's response upon successful execution.
 * The status may be "OK" or "NONE". Any failure on the server side triggers a
 * gpProcessorException. Any output of the command is passed to the gpDataSink 
 * that was provided as a parameter (or ignored if no sink was provided).
 * 
 * However, modifiers can be attached to the method name to cause the command's
 * outcome to be treated differently:
 * 
 * * if the method name is prefixed with "try_", no gpProcessorException are thrown.
 *   Instead, errors reported by the peer cause the method to return false.
 *   The cause of the error may be examined using the getStatus() and getStatusMessage()
 *   methods. Not that other exceptions like gpProtocollException or gpUsageException
 *   are still thrown as usual.
 * 
 * * if the method name is prefixed with "capture_", the command's output is collected
 *   and returned as an array of arrays, representing the rows of data. If the command
 *   fails, a gpProcessorException is raised, as usual (or, if try_ is also specified, 
 *   the method returns false).
 * 
 * * if the method name is suffixed with _map AND prefixed with "capture_", 
 *   the command's output is collected and returned as an associative array. 
 *   This is especially useful for commands like "stats" that provide values 
 *   for set of well known properties.
 *   To build the associative array, rows from the output are interpreted as 
 *   a key-value pairs. If the _map suffix is used without the capture_ prefix, 
 *   a gpUsageException is raised.
 * 
 * * if the method name is suffixed with _value, the command is expected
 *   to return a value in the status line, prefixed by either "OK." or "VALUE:". 
 *   The value is returned. If the command does not provide a VALUE or OK status,
 *   an exception is raised.
 * 
 * Modifiers can also be combined. For instance, try_capture_stats_map would
 * return GraphCore stats as an associative array, or null of the call failed.
 * 
 * Additional modifiers or extra virtual methods can be added by subclasses
 * by overriding the __call() method or by registering handlers with the
 * addCallHandler() or addExecHandler() methods.
